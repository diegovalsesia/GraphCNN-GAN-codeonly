# Requirements

  - Python 2.7
  - Tensorflow >=1.6 

# Usage
  
  A trained model for the method with aggregation upsampling is provided for the following Shapenet classes: airplane, chair, sofa, table.
  - launch_test.sh : generate a batch of point clouds from the specified class 
  - launch_train.sh : retrain the network (requires downloading the Shapenet dataset and place it in the data directory)
